# Maximum-Leaf-Spanning-Tree
Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree Problem is formulated and study of Complexity Analysis of the problem, 
its special cases is conducted and 
surveyed various Aproximate Algorithms and their approximability and the report on it is enclosed here
Implementation of Ravi & Lu's 3-approximate algorithm for Maximum Leaf-Spanning Tree is done (mlstp.cpp)
